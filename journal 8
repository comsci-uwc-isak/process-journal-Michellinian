Today we did some reading about types of changeover, and we wrote a summary about the reading that we did during class. 
We also learned a new thing in the repository, which is to create a homepage like thing. Without using html, with simple 
procedures we were able to create something that looks like a homepage of somethig, which helps us to organize our tasks.
Also a little before, we had 4 tasks to do about fiboacci, fixing the code, and so on. I was shocked when I got a 30, because 
I was sure I had done I everything I could. Although I did have to resubmit some stuffs, and I didn't create the monty hall 
problem. I thought I had to try a lot harder to keep up with other.
