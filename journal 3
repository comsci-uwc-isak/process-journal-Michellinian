Today was a very productive day. We learned some new commands in bash, and unlike yesterdays class, I got a better understanding
of how terminal works. Today I felt like Dr.Ruben taught us in a good speed, and I didn't have to ask any of my friends for help. 
I like writing this journal. It helps me reflect on what we did everyday, and keeps me on track.
