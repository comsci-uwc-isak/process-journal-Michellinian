Day 1: 
On the very first day of the class, we started off with a non-programming activity. I was very surprised by how much other studetns
knew about computers, and I felt like I needed to work hard in order to be able to be on the same page as the rest of the class.

Day 2: 
Today we learned about terminals and it was the first time uding terminal, so it was a little hard to follow.
I asked my friend once in a while, when I didn't uderstand something. I feel like for now, terminal is hard to use, since I am 
an ultimate beginner, but once I practice a little bit, I think I can manage to type in the commads fluently.
For the class style, I really liked how we had a 5 minutes break, because computer science can sometimes be overwhelming. It is 
a really good time for us to refresh our mind, so that we don't get tired and confused.

Day 3: 
Today was a very productive day. We learned some new commands in bash, and unlike yesterdays class, I got a better understanding
of how terminal works. Today I felt like Dr.Ruben taught us in a good speed, and I didn't have to ask any of my friends for help. 
I like writing this journal. It helps me reflect on what we did everyday, and keeps me on track. 

Day 4: 
Today we were introduced to if statements. I knew about if statements and, although the syntax is different the concept is exactly
the same so it was very easy to follow and to understand. The task of the ramen restaurant was a little bit challenging for me, so 
I got help from my friends. 

Day 5: 
Today was a coding day. Our task was to create an interactive game using if statements. During the class I couldn't finish 
because an error just kept popping up which I figured out that it had to do with "$!/bin/bash". After figuring out what the 
error was, I restarted the whole thing, becuase I got confused. After going back to the house I worked on it for quite a long 
time, and I finally maaged to finish it.

Day 6: 
Today we started with the while loops. But before that we started with the with a little quiz that checked the concepts of
computer science, that we covered in the class. After that we leared about while loops. While understanding the basic idea 
of how it works, the task that was given in the task was very hard. I was looking at the flowchart for quite a long time because
I didn't get what this game was about. I was already confused by the first conditional statement that said "!win", and so it took
me a long time to actually code this. Although I was able to, because I got a lot of help from my friends again.

Day 7:
We were given 4 tasks to do for today's class. Creating fibonacci sequence in bash, finding errors, creating monty hall problem 
in bash and drawing a flowchart. I was able to do all of them except for the thrid one. Although I understood the concept of 
the game, it was too hard for me to code it, so my friend sent me a code for this problem, which I have some problem understanding.

Day 8: 
Today we did some reading about types of changeover, and we wrote a summary about the reading that we did during class. 
We also learned a new thing in the repository, which is to create a homepage like thing. Without using html, with simple 
procedures we were able to create something that looks like a homepage of somethig, which helps us to organize our tasks.
Also a little before, we had 4 tasks to do about fiboacci, fixing the code, and so on. I was shocked when I got a 30, because 
I was sure I had done I everything I could. Although I did have to resubmit some stuffs, and I didn't create the monty hall 
problem. I thought I had to try a lot harder to keep up with other.

Day 9: 
First we did a short warm up of identifying the input/output and the steps of the program, which led to our final task for unit 1
which is to create a car rental program. We tried to link the context of the program with the syllabus 1.1.1. Today I learned 
what input ad output was, and I was able to identify them. Also I understood the Car rental app.

Day 10: 
Today we took our first step to creating the car rental app. Our first step was to create an install program. Essentially 
this program creates a folder "CarRentalApp", in the desktop, and inside that folder it automatically creates another folder which
are "db", short for database, and "scripts". This time. Dr. Pinzon, went through with us the whole process, so I had no difficulty 
understanding.

Day 11: 
After we created the install.sh, we made another program which was called the "frame". In this program, a message is supposed 
to show up when a certain code is executed. And the message is supposed to appear inside a box, that we also create within the 
program "frame". 
ex. 
*******************************************
*                                         *
*                 Welcome !               *
*                                         *
*******************************************
I had a hard time coding this, because it was somewhat complicating. I had to use a lot of seperate if statements, in the program
which made me confused. Maybe because I did without comments that made it harder for me to look at the codes. Next time I will
add some comments inside the code, so that it's easy for me to code, and also for other people to see my code.

Day12: 
Today we created "create.sh" and "record.sh". The first one is supposed to create a car, with the arguments that the user types
in. The user should type in "licensePlate, Model, Color, numberOfPassengers", and the create.sh should store that value in the 
maincarfile.txt, which is created inside the db folder. Then there is the record.sh where it creates a .txt file accordingly 
to the cars license plate. Meaning, it creates an individual .txt file for each car, storing the information, "km, startOfTrip 
, endOfTrip", whch are typed as arguments from the users. I managed to understand the code, although I didn't know how to connect 
these two programs. I couldn't figure out, how to create a file of an individual car. Whenever I execute "bash record.sh",
it always says, "File not found!", and I need help with how to fix this error.

Day13: 
During this class we first updated our car rental app repository. We identified our success criteria, and we also wrote about the
solution proposed. After that we did a short presentation about our assignments that the teacher gave us last lesson. We had 
to choose one of the four tasks, which were "edit, summary, delete, backup", I chose edit, although I couldn't cactually code
it, because I broke my computer. So I just summarized the steps of editting, and did a very brief presentation about it. I am 
planning on working with the code later in the day.
