Today we created a another program related to the RentalCarApp. We had to create a 100 x 5 box using *(asterisk marks), and
inside that box, in the center we had to echo the argument the user types in. For example when the user types in "bash frame 
Welcome" the outcome should be something like this:
************....***************
*                             *
*           Welcome           *
*                             *
*************...***************
Although it took me a long time, today I did it all the program by myself without the help of anyoe else, which I was very proud
of. I learned that I can program if I think very hard.
