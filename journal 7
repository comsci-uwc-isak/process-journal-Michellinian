We were given 4 tasks to do for today's class. Creating fibonacci sequence in bash, finding errors, creating monty hall problem 
in bash and drawing a flowchart. I was able to do all of them except for the thrid one. Although I understood the concept of 
the game, it was too hard for me to code it, so my friend sent me a code for this problem, which I have some problem understanding.
