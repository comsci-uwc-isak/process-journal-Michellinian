Today was a coding day. Our task was to create an interactive game using if statements. During the class I couldn't finish 
because an error just kept popping up which I figured out that it had to do with "$!/bin/bash". After figuring out what the 
error was, I restarted the whole thing, becuase I got confused. After going back to the house I worked on it for quite a long 
time, and I finally maaged to finish it.
