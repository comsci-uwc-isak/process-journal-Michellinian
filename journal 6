Today we started with the while loops. But before that we started with the with a little quiz that checked the concepts of
computer science, that we covered in the class. After that we leared about while loops. While understanding the basic idea 
of how it works, the task that was given in the task was very hard. I was looking at the flowchart for quite a long time because
I didn't get what this game was about. I was already confused by the first conditional statement that said "!win", and so it took
me a long time to actually code this. Although I was able to, because I got a lot of help from my friends again.
