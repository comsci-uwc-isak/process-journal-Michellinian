Today we learned about terminals and it was the first time uding terminal, so it was a little hard to follow.
I asked my friend once in a while, when I didn't uderstand something. I feel like for now, terminal is hard to use, since I am 
an ultimate beginner, but once I practice a little bit, I think I can manage to type in the commads fluently.
For the class style, I really liked how we had a 5 minutes break, because computer science can sometimes be overwhelming. It is 
a really good time for us to refresh our mind, so that we don't get tired and confused.
